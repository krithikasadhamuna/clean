A: See MODEL_INPUT_OUTPUT_SPECIFICATIONS.md for detailed feature
   descriptions for each model.

Q: Can I use these with my existing SIEM?
A: Yes! See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for integration examples with
   Splunk, ELK, and other platforms.

Q: What if I find a bug or issue?
A: Check DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md "Troubleshooting" section first.

Q: How often should I retrain?
A: Monthly recommended, weekly for high-security environments.
